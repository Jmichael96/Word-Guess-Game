## ABOUT
This game's logic is implemented with raw JavaScript. The largest obsticle I had during this assignment was 
correctly displaying the winning/losing image and text in the correct spot after each round finished. I Eventually found out
I wasn't calling my checkWin and checkLoss functions into the updateDisplay function. After that was corrected everything else fell into place and the app worked smoothly.

Languages Used:
- JavaScript 
- HTML5
- BootStrap 
- CSS

## HOW TO PLAY
Simply just touch a key to start the game. The theme is about sharks so try and guess the name of each shark!
When the game ends just type any key to start again!
